Context: In the popular kids show "Scooby-Doo", the main character has a speech
impediment that makes him replace all consonants at the start of a word until it
runs into a vowel with an "r". For example, the word "scooby" would become
"rooby" and “xylophone” would become “rophone”

Task: Write a program that "Scooby doos" any word or sentence a user inputs.

UI Design: Include a textbox for collecting the input, a button which the user clicks to process
the word or sentence and a means to display the result to the user.
